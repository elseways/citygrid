Home to the city\'s inhabitants who are more comfortable surrounded by nature, with the houses and apartments built in and around the trees and the nearby hillsides."},"u":{"color":"rgb(174, 93, 191)","name":"Unicorn Coast","description":"Filled with flower displays and marble fountains, Unicorn Coast is a classy but laid-back neighborhood on the northern shore of the city. It\'s a little remote, but the people here enjoy the quiet."},"p":{"color":"rgb(24, 120, 144)","name":"Prism Lake","description":"A calm lake surrounded by hills, with a long winding trail around the perimeter. Almost no one lives here, but a few people have claimed some space around and within the lake to build ambitious things."},"c":{"color":"rgb(148, 112, 68)","name":"Cajilla Canyon","description":"A sparsely populated rocky canyon linking the Near Wild to the main part of the city."},"g":{"color":"rgb(227, 178, 99)","name":"Ginger Valley","description":"Heart of the city\'s agriculture and restaurant scenes, Ginger Valley is a broad flatland full of farms, all fed by the river that flows out of the eastern hills. The western lowlands are more traditional and homespun, while the eastern sections contain the city\'s towering bioreactor farms."},"s":{"color":"rgb(127, 30, 150)","name":"Starview Flats","description":"A wide stretch of wild wind-swept desert uphill from Ginger Valley. Uninhabited, and popular with the Corps for testing experimental land vehicles or other devices that need to be kept well away from the city."},"m":{"color":"rgb(164, 155, 65)","name":"Makeshift Junction/Wyrmsborough","description":"Two neighborhoods share this space - Makeshift Junction, above-ground, is a wood-and-brass Western/steampunk sort of place full of steam valves and cogwheels, while Wyrmsborough is fully underground, full of carved stone and crystals that give it a sort of medieval-fantasy appearance. The steam that powers Makeshift Junction is geothermal, supplied by the magma beds of Wyrmsborough."},"r":{"color":"rgb(216, 0, 19)","name":"Riverfront","description":"The Riverfront was once a carnival midway full of rides and skill games, but once the larger Arch\xe6o Park was built next-door, it lost most of its appeal and the city turned the land over to become a freeform and somewhat anarchic artists\' colony. The inhabitants use the old machines and animatronics to hack together new and bizarre creations, so the place never looks the same two days in a row."},"a":{"color":"rgb(49, 206, 77)","name":"Arch\xe6o Park","description":"Built by Rufus Hydebound with the profits from Arcana Software, this large and popular theme park is built to resemble a large map of the globe, with appropriately themed rides and attractions throughout, all centered around the Atlantis Castle near the middle. The park sponsors a yearly puzzle contest which draws thousands of entrants from around the city."},"f":{"color":"rgb(5, 18, 102)","name":"FITZ (Fresnel Institute of Technology)","description":"The city\'s only university, named for the Cosmos Corps\' founder. It began with a focus on science and engineering, but has expanded to include full tracks in the humanities as well. Nobody knows what the Z stands for."},"b":{"color":"rgb(255, 240, 96)","name":"San Sigilio Beach","description":"A stretch of sandy beach with a few wooden piers jutting out into the ocean and circular concrete firepits. Home to surf shops, volleyball courts, and lots of live music. The beach is a popular place to live, whether that means an apartment away from the sand or just camping out by a fire all night."},"t":{"color":"rgb(207, 42, 126)","name":"Tashiyama Hills","description":"The hills are named for the Tashiyama clan of tanuki who call them their home and maintain the Tashiyama Resort, an Asian-styled getaway where residents can come to relax as long as they follow an unusual rule: anyone entering the resort must pass through the entrance gate and be transformed into some other shape (of their own choice). The same gate will restore you on exit, but while inside the resort it\'s impossible to tell who anyone might be on the outside (except, of course, the Tashiyama family themselves)."},"d":{"color":"rgb(53, 34, 151)","name":"Downtown","description":"Downtown Elseways is where the civic center and office buildings are. People who like city life fill the apartments here, frequenting the book stores, coffee shops, and delis. The Polywood district, in the southwest corner, is home to Elseways\' museums, theaters, and television studio."},"G":{"color":"rgb(247, 128, 34)","name":"Glenrock","description":"The city\'s largest and most populous neighborhood, and also home to its largest shopping mall. Glenrock has houses and schools, apartment buildings and grocery stores, parks, playgrounds, and everything people need to basically live day-to-day."},"x":{"color":"rgb(137, 46, 247)","name":"Nexus Center","description":"The Nexus Center is a half-mile-wide dome that contains the city\'s convention center and stadium as well as hotels and indoor shopping centers. This is where the Corps holds events that cater to people from multiple worlds; it\'s built to be a neutral place to showcase the best of Elseways. The interior is one large holographic emitter with an artificial sky overhead, and the Bitkin who reside here serve as the stage crew to dress the inside of the dome up to suit any occasion or theme they need it to be. The space around Nexus Center is the city\'s high-tech neighborhood, one of the only places where robots and digital life forms can reliably get parts and service."},"n":{"color":"rgb(60, 252, 222)","name":"Neopolis","description":"Centered around a complex of office buildings that house some of Elseways\' larger corporations (like Ringoid Labs and Arcana Software), Neopolis is the city\'s industrial core. Apart from the office complexes, there are warehouses and fabrication plants that serve the city\'s growing self-sufficiency."},"M":{"color":"rgb(0, 142, 148)","name":"Marine District","description":"The Marine District is home to both Elseways\' ocean port (where the Corps\' cargo ships come and go) and the marina, where residents who own boats - or live on them - have a place to keep them. Some of the city\'s more popular restaurants and event halls are placed along the waterline, where specially sealed windows look out both above and below water."},"W":{"color":"rgb(0, 0, 0)","name":"Wondervale","description":"A secluded valley a short distance from the city, Wondervale is one of the Corps\' worst-kept secrets. This is where they place people whose existence would threaten the safety of others just by existing, or who can manipulate large enough quantities of energy that they can\'t safely spend too much time around ordinary mortals - vampires, djinni, demigods, that sort of thing. Travel to and from Wondervale is heavily restricted and regulated."},"q":{"color":"rgb(0, 62, 130)","name":"Aqua Town","description":"This neighborhood, underwater on a coastal shelf, is where the city\'s aquatic and amphibious residents call home. Anyone who needs to stay below water some or all of the time is welcome here. An underground tunnel with airlocks connects it to the Marine District so people can come and go as they please (as long as they\'ve got the right kind of breathing equipment)."},"C":{"color":"rgb(255, 255, 255)","name":"Cosmos Corps HQ","description":"An old naval base became the Cosmos Corps\' new headquarters when they decided to move into the world they were repairing. Most of the place is closed to visitors - the hangars and airstrip, the laboratories and command centers, the barracks and training rooms - but the Corps maintains a building outside the security perimeter where city residents can come with questions or concerns that the city\'s Moderators aren\'t equipped to handle."},".":{"color":"rgb(189, 189, 189)","name":"Uninhabited","description":""},"_":{"color":"rgb(38, 77, 199)","name":"Pacific Ocean","description":""}}')},function(e,t,o){},function(e,t,o){"use strict";o.r(t);var a=o(1),n=o.n(a),r=o(4),i=o.n(r),s=(o(10),o(5)),l=o(3),h=o(0),c=o(12);function d(e){var t=e.rows,o=e.cols,n=e.tileSize,r=Object(a.useState)(null),i=Object(s.a)(r,2),d=i[0],u=i[1],m=null==d?".":l[d[0]].charAt(d[1]),p=c[m];var g=function(e,t,o,a){for(var n=[],r=function(e){for(var r=function(t){var r=l[e][t];n.push(Object(h.jsx)("rect",{x:t*o,y:e*o,width:o,height:o,onMouseOver:function(){return u([e,t])},onClick:function(){return console.log([e,t])},style:{fill:c[r].color,stroke:"."!==a&&a===r?"rgba(255,255,255,0.3)":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)"}}))},i=0;i<t;i++)r(i)},i=0;i<e;i++)r(i);return n}(t,o,n,m);return Object(h.jsxs)("div",{style:{border:"1px solid white"},children:[Object(h.jsx)("svg",{height:t*n,width:o*n,style:{border:"1px solid white",margin:"10px"},onMouseLeave:function(){return u(null)},children:g}),Object(h.jsx)("div",{style:{fontSize:"18px",fontFamily:"Raleway",fontWeight:300,color:"white",margin:"0px 10px 10px 10px",maxWidth:o*n},children:null==d?"Hover over the map":p.name}),Object(h.jsx)("div",{style:{fontSize:"14px",fontFamily:"Raleway",fontWeight:300,color:"white",margin:"0px 10px 10px 10px"},children:null==d?"
